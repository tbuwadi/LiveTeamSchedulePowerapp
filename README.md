# Live Team Schedule

## What it is?
At a glance, the live team schedule is a Microsoft PowerApps tool that shows which employees are currently clocked in/out and sends a Teams notification to selected users such as managers when someone signs in or out. With many of my co-workers being students who work unusual part time hours, full time employees needed a way to see who was currently in office and ready to take on a task!

## Prototype
This was a quick prototype I made in Figma before I started the project.

## Tools Used
* Figma for the prototype
* Microsoft PowerApps for the application
* Sharepoint Lists for the backend
* Power Automate Flow to send a message in Teams when the clock in/out buttons were triggered in PowerApps
